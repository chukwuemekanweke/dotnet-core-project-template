## Rule

Treat commands, requests, responses, results, and similar transport/application DTOs as `record` types by default, not `class`. Prefer positional record syntax:

```csharp
public sealed record SignUpCommand(string Email, string Password);
```

This applies to Application feature commands/responses/results, WebAPI request DTOs, and `Contracts` commands/events (see [[async-processing]]). Domain entities are not DTOs and follow normal entity
conventions instead (private constructors, factory methods) — this rule does not apply to them.
