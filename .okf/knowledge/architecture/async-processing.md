## Shape

- `Contracts` defines the commands and events that cross process boundaries (`BaseCommand`, `BaseEvent`, and concrete types like `UserCreated`, `SuccessfulPaymentConfirmed`, `SendNotificationCommand`).
  Application, Infrastructure, Consumer and Jobs all reference `Contracts`; `Contracts` references nothing else in the solution.
- Application handlers that need to trigger async work write to the transactional outbox (`IOutboxWriter`) in the same database transaction as their domain change — never publish directly to RabbitMQ from a request-handling path.
- `Jobs.OutboxProcessing.OutboxMessageProcessor` polls/listens (`OutboxNotificationListener`) for pending outbox rows and hands them to `RabbitMqOutboxMessageDispatcher`, which publishes to RabbitMQ and marks the row dispatched.
- `Consumer` hosts message handlers (subclassing `BaseMessageHandler`) that receive `Contracts` commands/events from RabbitMQ and perform the actual side effect (send email, credit wallet, activate subscription, etc).
  Inbound messages are deduplicated via a message inbox.

## Constraints

- Never publish to RabbitMQ directly from an Application/WebAPI request path; always go through the outbox so the write and the intent-to-publish commit atomically.
- New cross-process command/event types belong in `Contracts`, not defined ad hoc inside Application or Consumer.
- Consumer handlers must be idempotent-safe against redelivery (see the message inbox pattern already used) and must mark their `Activity` as errored on failure — see [[observability]].

See [[persistence]] for how the outbox table itself is persisted, and [[unit-testing]]/[[integration-testing]] for handler/background-service test coverage requirements.
