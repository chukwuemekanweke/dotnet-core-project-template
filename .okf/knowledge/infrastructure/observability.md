## Actor identity in telemetry

Use `StakeholderId` in custom observability events/spans for actor or subject identification whenever it can be resolved (via `CustomTelemetryContext`); fall back to `UserId`/`Email`/other identifiers
only when `StakeholderId` is genuinely unavailable. See [[dotnet-style]].

## Sampling architecture — do not add head sampling to application code

- Application code always emits complete telemetry. There is no sampling decision in app code, and none should be added there.
- Local development relies on an OTel Collector `tail_sampling` processor (`observability/otel-collector/otel-collector.yml`) that keeps error-status traces, slow traces
  (`OTEL_TAIL_SAMPLING_LATENCY_MS`), and a probabilistic fraction of the rest (`OTEL_TAIL_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE`). This only affects the local traces pipeline; logs/metrics and cloud OTLP export are
  untouched.
- Cloud (Grafana Cloud) relies on Grafana's own Adaptive Traces sampling, configured outside this repo — do not attempt to replicate or override that from application code.
- For tail sampling to have something to key off, code paths that own an `Activity` and encounter a failure must mark it `ActivityStatusCode.Error` and record the exception — see
  `GlobalExceptionHandler` (WebAPI), `RabbitMqOutboxMessageDispatcher`, and `BaseMessageHandler` (Consumer) for the existing pattern. Any new top-level error boundary (a new global exception handler, a
  new base message-handler type) should follow the same pattern.

## Constraint

Do not add probabilistic/head sampling logic in Application, WebAPI, Consumer, or Jobs code. If a new failure-handling boundary is added, mark its `Activity` as errored the same way the existing ones do, so local tail sampling keeps it.
