## Shape

- PostgreSQL via EF Core. `AppDbContext` (writes) and `AppReadDbContext` (read models) both derive from `AppDbContextBase`; entity configurations live under `Persistence/Configurations/` (one `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` per entity).
- Domain code depends on repository/specification abstractions defined in `Domain` (e.g. `IAggregateRoot`-based repositories, `SpecificationEvaluator`); `Infrastructure` provides
  `EfRepository`/`EfReadRepository` implementations. Do not query `DbContext` directly from Application — go through a repository or read-model repository.
- Cross-cutting persistence behavior (audit fields, soft delete, observability spans around commands) is implemented via `SaveChangesInterceptor`s (`AuditAndSoftDeleteInterceptor`,
  `ObservabilityCommandInterceptor`), not by repeating that logic in each handler.
- `CurrentActorAccessor` resolves the acting stakeholder for audit fields; use it instead of re-deriving the actor from `HttpContext` in Infrastructure/Application code.
- Read-only, denormalized query paths (e.g. `StakeholderReadModelRepository`, `WalletTransactionReadModelRepository`) go through `AppReadDbContext`, not the write context.

## Constraint

New entities need an explicit `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` — do not rely on EF Core conventions alone for anything with non-trivial constraints, indexes, or owned types. New aggregates need a
specification-based query path rather than ad hoc LINQ scattered across handlers.
