## Shape

- Application/Domain depend on `IObjectStorageService`/`IObjectStorageProvider` (Domain-defined), never on Cloudflare R2 SDK types directly. `CloudflareR2ObjectStorageProvider` (built via
  `ICloudflareR2ClientFactory`) is the real implementation; `NoopObjectStorageProvider` is used where object storage is not configured (e.g. some test/dev paths).
- Runtime provider selection is data-driven through the active `FileStorage` row in `infrastructure.Providers`. The Cloudflare implementation and seed data use the exact key
  `cloudflare_r2`; the template seed activates it and deactivates `noop`. Docker Compose forwards the seven `CLOUDFLARE_R2_*` launcher variables into the corresponding
  `ObjectStorage__CloudflareR2__*` .NET configuration keys for WebAPI, Consumer, and Jobs.
- `PublicBaseUrl` is required. URLs returned for objects uploaded or promoted to the public bucket are always built from this public development/custom-domain base URL, never from the
  private S3 API endpoint and bucket name.
- Uploads use a presigned-URL flow: the client requests a presigned upload (`ObjectStoragePresignedUploadRequest`/`Result`), uploads directly to R2, then the app promotes the object from a
  quarantine/staging visibility to its final visibility (`ObjectStoragePromotionRequest`, `ObjectStorageVisibility`) once validated. This is the pattern the `AvatarUploads` and `Common/FileUploads`
  features implement — a `FileUploadSession` entity tracks the lifecycle.
- Rejected/orphaned uploads are cleaned up asynchronously via `Contracts.Commands.Storage.DeleteQuarantinedObject`, dispatched through the outbox (see [[transactional-outbox]]), not deleted synchronously in the request path.

## Constraint

New file-upload features reuse `IObjectStorageService` and the existing presign → upload → promote lifecycle rather than inventing a new upload mechanism per feature.
