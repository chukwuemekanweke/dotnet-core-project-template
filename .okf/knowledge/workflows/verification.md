## Rule

Always run build and test sequentially. Never run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` concurrently in this repository — parallel execution can leave `testhost` processes holding DLL locks and cause transient copy failures during build.

## Order

1. `dotnet format BackendProjectTemplate.slnx style --no-restore --verify-no-changes --diagnostics IDE0005`
2. `dotnet build BackendProjectTemplate.slnx --no-restore`
3. `dotnet test BackendProjectTemplate.slnx --no-build`

Run this as the standard verification flow after any code change, before considering work complete.
