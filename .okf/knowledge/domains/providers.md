## Scope

`Provider` is a generic aggregate keyed by `ProviderType` (currently `Email`, `FileStorage`) with a name/key and an `IsActive` flag, activated/deactivated via the `ActivateProvider` feature. This is
the registry for which concrete external-service implementation is currently active for a given provider type — it is **not** the same concept as a payment provider (Credo/SafeHaven), which is modeled
separately under [[payments]] (`PaymentProvider`, `ActivatePaymentProvider`).

When adding a new externally-swappable integration that needs an on/off or which-implementation-is-active switch, check whether it fits this generic `Provider` registry before inventing a parallel activation mechanism.

Follows the standard [[vertical-slices]] feature-folder shape and the [[unit-testing]]/[[integration-testing]] conventions.
